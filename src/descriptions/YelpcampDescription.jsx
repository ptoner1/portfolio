            <b><i>Disclaimer:</i></b> I followed along a tutorial series with Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp
            to build this.&nbsp; I learned so much from this course and its capstone project- Yelp Camp,
            which is essentially a Yelp clone for campgrounds.&nbsp; My code was hosted on Heroku for a few months,
            but they took it down when they stopped providing free web hosting.
