        <p><i>Love Spotify.</i>  Fantastic app.</p>
        <p>It can do almost anything I'd want it to do.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            However, it doesn't allow its users to sort their 'liked songs' playlist by any metrics
            whatsoever so I made an app that allows users to filter and sort their liked songs and
            save the results as a new playlist. &nbsp;I deployed it to the web because I actually expect
            my friends and family to use it.

            <b>If you want to use the app, </b>
            please send me the email you use for your spotify account and I'll add you as
            an authorized user.
