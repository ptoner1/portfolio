        <p><i>Love Spotify.</i>  Fantastic app.</p>
        <p>It can do almost anything I'd want it to do.</p>
        <br />
        However, it doesn't allow its users to sort their 'liked songs' playlist by any metrics
        whatsoever so I made an app that allows users to filter and sort their liked songs and
        save the results as a new playlist. &nbsp;I deployed it to the web because I actually expect
        my friends and family to use it.
